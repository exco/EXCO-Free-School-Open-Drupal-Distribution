This file contains a log of changes to the API.

API version 1.1.0:
  delegator module destroyed, replaced by page manager. All 'task' and 'task_handler' plugins 
  now owned by page_manager. Update plugin hooks accordingly. The filename for defaults
  for pages and handlers should now be MODULE.pages_default.inc

  The task_type plugin has been removed.

  Task handlers no longer have a separate UI. While task handlers can still 
  be separated from pages for other purposes, they will probably need
  to implement their own UI to do it.

API version 1.0:
  Initial CTools API version.
