Add a hook to allow other modules to cooperate a bit more easily with node page overriding.
#472222: Prevent modules providing invalid user data from causing warnings in profile content.
#478438 by nickl: Allow passing items to the data() element.

#447064 by nickl: Improve requirements message when css cache directory cannot be created.
#481928: Needed indexes on delegator handlers and pages tables.
#484284 by crea: Add a node links content type to print just a node's links.
#485486 by nrambeck: term view override was not setting breadcrumb like taxonomy/term is supposed to.
#498000: Allow .info files to create data for plugins.
Fix a bug in plugins.inc where if two modules create a plugin of the same

#512048: by tom_o_t: Path fallback override callback had bad logic.

IMPORTANT:
Removed the delegator module entirely. There is now a page_manager module in 
its place, with a vastly improved workflow and user interface. Activating it 
should automatically update your data to the new module. However, PLEASE 
PLEASE PLEASE back up your data before using it. Just enough changed to make
this a bit of a concern.

#508292 by rfay: Add user comparison access plugin.
API version bumped to 1.1.0 to reflect the death of delegator.
